        "a": "Differential Pulse Voltammetry",

        "d": "Linear-sweep voltammeter"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Differential pulse voltammetry is a modern, more sensitive technique but not the basis of classical polarography.",
        "b": "Cyclic voltammetry is a different voltammetric method, not typically used in classical polarography.",
        "c": "Correct. Normal Pulse Voltammetry is a time-dependent current measurement method closely linked to polarography.",
        "d": "Linear-sweep is also a voltammetric method but less commonly used in classical polarography."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. All these compounds can undergo redox reactions measurable by polarographic methods.",
        "b": "Hormones like steroids can be analyzed polarographically if electroactive.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Sulfhydryl (-SH) compounds can be reduced at DME.",
        "b": "Aryl methane is typically not electroactive under standard polarographic conditions.",
        "c": "Correct. Disulfides (–S–S–) are reducible at DME.",
