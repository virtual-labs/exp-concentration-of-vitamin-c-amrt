      "question": "E½ represents which of the following parameter?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Residual current",
        "b": "Half-wave potential",
        "c": "Average diffusion current",
        "d": "Sum of the diffusion residual current"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Residual current is the small current present even in absence of electroactive species. It is not E½.",
        "b": "Correct. Half-wave potential (E½) is the potential at which half of the limiting current is reached in polarography.",
        "c": "Average diffusion current refers to mean value of diffusion current, not a potential.",
        "d": "Sum of the diffusion and residual currents doesn't define E½."

      "question": "Choose the organic functional groups that are reducible at DME.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Nitrate",
        "b": "All the above",
        "c": "Alkene",
        "d": "Nitrite"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Nitrate is reducible at dropping mercury electrode (DME) under suitable conditions.",
        "b": "Correct. Nitrate, nitrite, and some alkenes can be reduced at DME.",
        "c": "Some alkenes can undergo electrochemical reduction at DME.",
        "d": "Nitrite is reducible and often studied using polarography."
